## Device documentation

[This](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4.2inch_e-Paper_Cloud_Module) is the offical waveshare documentation, however it does not cover everything about the device and is translated from Chineese. I have made an attempt at making my own documentation, but it is not complete. If you would like to help out, it would be great if you could contribute!

You can find my version of the documentation [here](DISPLAYDOCS.md)
